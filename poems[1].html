<h3>Virtual world</h3>
<pre class="poem">
How true is the love on Instagram,
Only writing couple goals with hashtags,
Everything is always perfect somewhere,
Even coconuts are sometimes broken by God,

There is a different kind of fun in trying to please someone,
Where else is life colorful,
No relationship is ever perfect,
There is only a virtual world on social media....

Prepare for flight,
You will get wings.

<h3>The difficult path of love</h3>
<pre class="poem">
It's not that difficult to love,
It's not that difficult to fill someone's heart,
It's difficult to keep loving,
And
Keep filling the same person's heart....

<h3>A cup of memories</h3>
<pre class="poem">
Strange roads have become familiar now,
Where are you going? Then they said to your house.
Will you do one thing on the way?
Will you turn around a little slowly near her house?
Ask her how she is, lady,
Do you miss us or not.
Let's meet and have a chat sometime,
Let's fill the cup of memories to the brim...
